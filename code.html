	<p>hey there, you might be able to relate up to me cause i'm technically worthLESS so... it's not that y'all too are but i mean you must have had an exentsial crisis to some degree of extent at least once ! if not, then you're god cause so much believe in yourself is a damn cool thing but sometimes it becomes over-confidence and you go down to the hill so... yeah !
	well, i have something to share with maybe my future self idk. </p>


<p>you see, there is this girl who used to study with me ..let's name her 'riya'. riya was good-looking, topper and RICH and i was dumb, ugly and poor. yes, i do envy her now too cause she is smart, get's a good rank in class, looks cool, is unique but i am none.i wonder up to myself why am i like this huh ? but the answer is within me .
that hardwork, sacrfice and motivatoion that wads behind in her journey was the key which wasn't in mine case. 
but yo i have a question that i asked when i was 10, how to be hardworking ?
i still am clueless about this. idk i have multiple breakdowns and what you call teen-depression. i feel worthless. it feels like i don't matter. i am just a burden. i am just so afraid to talk to my parents and friends. it just that it causes me to be more introverted. </p>
